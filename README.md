# Cancer-Class-Detection
This is a real world case study on detection class of cancer in a patient. This would be helpful for doctors because it takes an cancer specialist a huge amount to time to detect that a patient is suffering from which class of cancer. We can automate this process which would be very much helpful for the doctor as it would save their lots of time. We would also predict the probability of each class so that if our model is very much sure then only the doctor would trust the prediction by our model but if our model is not very sure then doctor would analyse the patient themselves to determine the class of cancer. We are given Patient ID, Variation, Gene, Text and Class in the dataset and then we will use bag of word to perform one hot encoding of every feature. We would use Bag of Word to vectorize the text feature. We have used accuracy score as model performance measurement.
